## General Information

### Motivation
I created this program to practice my coding skills and learn more about
the calculations happening in the background of the games

### Functionality
- Stat calculation based on the user's given information
  including the name, nature, IVs, and EVs of the Pokemon
- Allows the user to save a build for a Pokemon

### Future Plans
Here are a few things I might add to the calculator:
- Damage calculator
- Nature, IVs, and EVs explanation

## Setup

### Technologies
This program was created with:
- Python 3.10.11

### Running the Program:
- Download and place all files together in a directory that you
  can easily access
- To run the program:
```
$ cd ../"stat_calc"
$ python main.py
```
(Note: "stat_calc" is a placeholder for the directory you choose to place the files in)
- Follow the program's instructions and find your calculations
- You could also run the program in an IDE. If this is the case, I
suggest VSCode or IDLE. To run it, select the file in the IDE and
click run
