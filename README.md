# Pokemon Stat Calculator
Calculator that computes the expected stat values of a Pokemon given
the Pokemon's Name, Nature, IVs, and EVs

## Motivation
I created this program to practice my coding skills and learn more about
the calculations happening in the background of the games

## How to Run
- Download an IDE or have some method to run Python files
  (I suggest VSCode or IDLE as they are very easy to use!)
- Download and place all files together in a directory that you
  can easily access
- Run "main.py" in the IDE
- Follow the program's instructions and find your Pokemon's
  expected stats

## What is Included?
- Stat calculation based on the user's given information
  including the name, nature, IVs, and EVs of the Pokemon

## Anything planned for the Future?
Here are a few things I might add to the calculator:
- Damage calculator
- Nature, IVs, and EVs explanation
